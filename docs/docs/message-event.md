# Receive Message Event

The next step is to finally receive the message.  
The atmosphere is becoming more and more like a bot!  

:::warning
Note, however, that to receive the group's message, the decrypt key in `FileStorage` or so on, as described in [Start 2](/docs/start-2).
:::

First, let's create a bot that only receives “!ping” and returns “pong!”.  

## Chat

To receive messages, do the following.

```ts
client.on("message", (message) => {
    ...
});
```

This is all that is needed to receive the message.  
Easy, isn't it?

So first, let's retrieve the messages sent.  

```ts
client.on("message", (message) => {
    const text = message.content;

    console.log(text);
});
```

Your console should now show the message that was sent to you!  

```console
Hello EdamAmex
I love you! :D
```

Next, let's check if the message is “!ping”.  

```ts
client.on("message", (message) => {
    const text = message.content;

    if (text === "!ping") {
        ...     
    }
});
```

This is perfect. Next time I need to reply.  

To reply, you can call a method that sends a `messageId` with a `relatedMessageId`, but there is a more convenient way.  

```ts
client.on("message", (message) => {
    const text = message.content;

    if (text === "!ping") {
        message.reply("pong!");
    }
});
```

What a beautiful code!
It's too easy. However, in this case, it is more beautiful to enclose it in an asynchronous function.

```ts
client.on("message", async (message) => {
    const text = message.content;

    if (text === "!ping") {
        await message.reply("pong!");
    }
});
```

That's all!  
There are also `send`, `reaction`, etc.  
Let me explain all the methods in other chapters.  

## Square
So what should we do with Square (OpenChat)?
Basically the same thing.

```ts
client.on("square:message", async (message) => {
    const text = message.content;

    if (text === "!ping") {
        await message.reply("pong!");
    }
});
```

With this alone you can create a basic bot.  
There are many more features!

Stay tuned for our next journey.
